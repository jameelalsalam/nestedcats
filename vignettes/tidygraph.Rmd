Nested categories are represented in a graph structure, and thus we need convenient tools for creation and manipulation of the graphs that will represent the nested categories. One strong possibility is the [tidygraph](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/index.html) package by Thomas Lin Pedersen, which builds on top of igraph and tidyverse approaches.

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```


```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidygraph)
library(nestedcats)

gr <- tribble(
  ~from, ~to,
  
)
```
